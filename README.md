ENGG1340 Project of 3035691054. I am Cheng Ira Rafael D and I am a year 1 BENGG strudent with the UID 3035691054; this is a solo project as my group mate hasn't to my emails for the group project, I was in group 144, and we made zero progress therefore this is my solo project.

The game I will be implementing will be called Wandering Warrior, it is a text based monster battling adventure game where a player will be able to fight monsters in a text based style. 

The game will start by asking how many monsters you would like to encounter and the player can input the number and he will then fight monsters with random names and statistics.

I intend to implement a critical strike mechanic which will increase the damage output of the player by 25% and randomly occurs.

Players can chose to continue on their journey and immediately fight a monster or rest at an Inn. Resting at an inn will break their combo.

I also intend to implement a combo mechanic where the player's score increases faster for each consecutive monster Killed without stopping at an inn.

Many events from the game, namely the chance of critical strike, what monsters will appear, and what attacs they will use against you, will make use of a random number generator.
